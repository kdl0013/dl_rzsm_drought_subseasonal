# dl_rzsm_drought_subseasonal
Research project investigating the improvments in forecast skill using a combined dynamical-deep learning framework.

Many of the scripts are Jupyter Notebooks which can be run for different regions. Because of different data sources,  formatting issues, and time constraints, it was decided to simply create different scripts to ensure everything was executed correctly. 

The jupyter notebooks are expected to be run in order to produce the desired data. BUT first if you are going to fully recreate this study then you will need to get the data from the appropriate sources.

### Data Sources ###

ECWMF began migrating their data to a new source (https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/s2s/levtype=sfc/type=cf/). This means that the download scripts may not work anymore after July 2024.

GEFSv12 data is downloaded from source https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ae4rze4k5yi74. 

Link to the publication will be provided after peer-review process.
